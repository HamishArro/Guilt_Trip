# Sloth

## About

Welcome to Sloth!
This app is built to make getting out of the house and stretching your legs fun.
As we all know, sloth is one of the seven deadly sins. In this case it’s deadly for your sloths!
You start with sloths and a step target for the day. The app tracks your steps by using a pedometer. If your daily target is reached, your snuggle of sloths grows. If you don’t hit your target, a sloth dies!

## What the user is shown

When a user logs in for the first time:

- When the user opens the app they are greeted with a welcome message
- When the user clicks okay on the welcome message they are displayed with their starting sloths, a board at the bottom of the screen (with their statistics to do with steps on it) and a sloth with the info button on it.
- On the stats board at the bottom of the page the user is displayed with: Target steps, remaining steps, current steps whilst app is open and number of sloths they have on the tree.

When the user closes the app and logs back in the same day:

- They will be greated with a welcome back message.
- The same features listed above will remain the same.
