# Sloth

## About
- Hi, welcome to Sloth! Sloth was designed to put the fun in walking an otherwise boring task. It achives this by giving the user a snuggle of sloths which they have to take care of by reacing their daily step count target. This Target is dynamically updated depending on how many sloths the user has. If they dont reach their target they will lose their uniquely generated sloth and their passions for good.
